        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I was 10 when I wrote my first computer program. In the dark basement tech lab of my school, the Iron Curtain still in place, I made a Soviet IBM-knockoff play The Beatles' Yellow Submarine.</p>
        <p>The teacher told me I was cute, but coding was for boys. It was what everyone else was telling me about math, and chess, and RPGs, and so I believed him, and it took me the longest time to find my way back here.</p>
        <p>So hi! Hello! I'm Cam, and I wrote this in HTML. With some light CSS styling. And already it looks better than anything I've ever cooked, so there.</p>
        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I'm a Brit living in the US, but I was born in Poland, and spent some time in Mozambique as well. (Yes, I can still speak Polish, took 8 years of German, picked up Portuguese while in Africa, and recently started on ASL and Spanish.)</p>
        <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <p>Learning new languages. Skiing. Sailing. Hiking.</p>
        <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
        <p>Applications architect.</p>
        <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
        <p>Seattle, WA.</p>
        <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>For years, I kept thinking that "somebody should build" the apps I wished for, only to realize that I could be that somebody.</p>
